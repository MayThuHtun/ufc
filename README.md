														Abstract

	The project can be presented about a converter to translate some Myanmar language fonts. Myanmar Language tool’s goal is to develop a useful converter for translating texts between Myanmar languages in real time with high quality. Myanmar Language converter is a type of link that upload on website. In coding, we had used Python language to convert Zawgyi, Unicode and WinMyanmar vice visa.
	To form our converter design, we had taken some templates such as Materialize, MDL and Bootstrap. And then, we developed the associate coding for our project.  Our converter’s coding and design were merged into a good converter link. We uploaded it on the website.
	The part of documentation is to show how our converter had worked step by step. Finally, Myanmar Language Tools is released as a secure link for users to be used easily as a commercial page of application.

						CHAPTER 1
						INTRODUCTION

1.1	Introduction

	Nowadays, Mobile phones are very useful for everyone to communicate with each other. Business people widely used Laptop, desktop, mobile phone and other devices. Generally, most of the device’s fonts are not convenience for Unicode font. So, most of the device users are reliable on font converters for converting the fonts. 
	Font converters are developed and uploaded at online. Especially, the most changes fonts are Zawgyi to Unicode or Unicode to Zawgyi. Some people are applied WinMyanmar font. Now they are facing font problem in Myanmar fonts. They should use our font converter link that might help them for those problems. Today, there are too many companies which produce many devices with different fonts. To solve font problems, you must need to have a font converter.


1.2	Background of the system

	We have to consider about the method, approach, programming language and tools in developing the project. Methodology will be represented our project requirements and project plan. In development life cycle we stated that design, implementation of the project, and testing. In this project, we used Git, Github, Gitbush, Python, Pycharm, Heroku, Materialize CSS and Html.
1.2.1	Git
 
	Git is a content management and tracking system developed by Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. It includes a directory that continuously changes as codes are added throughout application or website development. Git also tracks revisions that are performed on stored data. 

1.2.2	Github

	GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. 
It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
GitHub offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts which are commonly used to host open-source software projects.

1.2.3	Git bash

	Git Bash for Windows is not just bash compiled for Windows. It's package that contains bash and a collection of other, separate nix utilities and others compiled for Windows, and a new command-line interface terminal window called mintty.
They are usually stored under /user/bin rather than in C:\Windows\system32 on nix systems because Windows and nix have their system file structure organized differently.

1.2.4	Python

 	Python is a multiparadigm, general-purpose, interpreted, high-level programming language. Python allows programmers to use different programming styles to create simple or complex programs, get quicker results and write code almost as if speaking in a human language.
 	Some of the popular systems and applications that have employed Python during development include Google Search, YouTube, Bit Torrent, Google App Engine, Eve Online, Maya and iRobot machines.

1.2.5	Pycharm

	Pycharm editor is a powerful tool for creating and modifying source code.
As any other IDE editor, it supports basic features like bookmark, breakpoints, syntax highlighting, code completion, zooming, folding code blocks, etc. There are, however, plenty of advanced features like macros, highlighted TODO items, code analysis, intention actions, intelligent and fast navigation, and a lot more.

1.2.6	Heroku 

	Heroku is Platform as a Service cloud offering that provisions the development of Web applications and services. It is a cloud application development platform that provides development tools, scalable processing power and cloud management functionality.
 Heroku was initially developed for Ruby on Rails and now support various other development languages.

1.2.7	Materialize CSS
	
	Created and designed by Google, Material Design is a design language that combines the classic principles of successful design along with innovation and technology. Google's goal is to develop a system of design that allows for a unified user experience across all their products on any platform.

1.2.8	HTML
 
	Hypertext markup language (HTML) is the major markup language used to display Web pages on the Internet. In other words, Web pages are composed of HTML, which is used to display text, images or other resources through a Web browser. 
All HTML is plain text, meaning it is not compiled and may be read by humans. The file extension for an HTML file is .htm or .html.

1.2.9	JQuery

	JQuery is a JavaScript library that allows web developers to add extra functionality to their websites. It is open source and provided for free under the MIT license. In recent years, jQuery has become the most popular JavaScript library used in web development.
To implement jQuery, a web developer simply needs to reference the jQuery JavaScript file within the HTML of a webpage. Some websites host their own local copy of jQuery, while others simply reference the library hosted by Google or the jQuery server.

1.2.10	JavaScript

	JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server.

1.3	Objective of the project

•	To solve the difficulties of any devices users, especially for android users who have not fonts with their device.

•	To display user’s converted text

•	To convenience for office staff, people in IT fields

•	To save time for users

•	To reduce human errors

•	To use with low cost

•	To see clearly fonts


					CHAPTER  2

					METHDOLOGY

2.2		Software selection
 
	We would like to use python as programming language in my project because there are a lot of benefits to pick up Python languages in many windows form application. 
    
•	Python can simply code and it can be very easy to develop and can be reformed very quickly. 

•	Python is particularly available and has multiple extensions. 

•	Python is very popular so we can find many references and guidelines from the internet. 

•	They are readily available and easy to access. 

•	Python can interface easily with MSSQL and allow developers to create dynamic website. 



2.3	Project Plan

In understanding the system requirements and testing some features, we work together. Developer, UI/UX, testing and documentation, we work together. In this system, how to use converter for user and to solve the difficulties of any devices users, especially for android users who have not fonts with their device


							CHAPTER 3
							CONCLUSION

3.1	Conclusion

	The system provides simple and complete functions for user without necessarily changes. Beyond our purpose, you can choose the fonts that would you like to change. One touch of our fingers on click the convert button which show the font do our desire’s view. This converter helps both Zawgyi font users and Unicode font users.
